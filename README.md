OC-Compiler
===========
Created by Jeffrey Deng (JeffreyKDeng) and Kevin Andres (kevinjandres)

An 'oc' compiler made for CMPS 104a (Fall 2013) at University of California, Santa Cruz.
This compiler compiles code written in the source language 'oc'.
Demonstrates the usage of a lexical analyzer, an LALR parser, a symbol table (with type-checking), and code generation.

NOTE: still some problems with type-checking
